# Hamming One
An implementation of simple algorithm finding solution to Hamming One problem, using CPU and GPU CUDA programming.

## Problem 

For a set of n vectors of binary numbers find all pairs such that the Hamming distance between them is equal to one.

Hamming distance is equal to the number of positions on which digits of two vectors of the same length differ.

## Running the project

In order to launch both implementation use ./comparioson.sh which will create file with comparison of both CPU and GPU implementations.
